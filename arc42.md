arc42: Effective, lean and pragmatic architecture documentation and communication
===

arc42 offers a clear, simple and effective structure to document and communicate your software system.

![image-left](arc42.assets/cabinet-sanwal-deen-300px.jpg)Compare the arc42 sections to the *drawers* of a cabinet. arc42 contains 12 such drawers, each one specialized to hold a specific kind of information about the architecture of a system.

arc42 is optimized for understandability and adequacy. It naturally guides you to explain any kind of architecture information or decision in an understandable way.

#### arc42 supports ANY kind of system or project[Permalink](arc42-supports-any-kind-of-system-or-project)

arc42 supports your style of working, your domain and your technology. Apply it in agile, lean or formal projects - you decide.

# Painless documentation

arc42 users **like** the *understandability*, that mainly results from its standardized structure.

But what they really **love** is the *manageable effort* it takes to create and maintain arc42-based architecture documentation. We call it “*painless documentation*”, using the arc42 template does not require additional effort:

- You only describe things that your stakeholders really have to know.
- You explain facts and issues that are necessary to understand the system or individual design decisions.
- You only keep track of important architecture decision that you had to make anyhow.
